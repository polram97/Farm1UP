# Farm1UP
Farm1UP
We are a group of IEEE ESPE students from Ecuador and we will develop Farm 1 UP to reach Zero Hunger

Here is:
1) A Python notebook that predicts the weather by a written location
2) An Arduino code for receive data from the LORA sensors (remote temperature and moisture sensors)
3) The Unity file where we simulated an agriculture environment ("Call for Code" is the executable file; "Alt+F4" for quit the app)

4) Links for our video (Youtube and Drive option)
5) Our architecture
