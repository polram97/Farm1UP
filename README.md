# Farm1UP
Farm1UP
We are a group of IEEE ESPE students from Ecuador and we will develop Farm 1 UP to reach Zero Hunger

Here is:
- A Python notebook that predicts the weather by a written location
- An Arduino code for receive data from the LORA sensors (remote temperature and moisture sensors)
- The Unity file where we simulated an agriculture environment

- Links for our video (Youtube and Drive option)
